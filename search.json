In other words, \\(B\\) might not have occured if \\(A\\) did not happen first. Note how we implicitly consider what didn’t happen whenever we make a causal statement: we consider the counterfactual.\n\n\nConsider that any event could have multiple causes. Even if you did not oversleep, you could be late to class because of traffic, a phone call, a rainstorm… \\(A\\) might be sufficient to cause \\(B\\) but not necessary if another event \\(C\\) could have caused it.\n\n“I might not have been late to class if I did not oversleep.”\n\nEven though the counterfactual is counter to what happened this time, we might know from experience that the story could have gone another way. The counterfactual is taken into account when we make causal statements regardless of whether it actually occured.",

This means that an antecedent event may influence the probability of the event in question, but not guarantee it.\n\n\nMaybe \\(A\\) does not guarantee \\(B\\) but it does make \\(A\\) more likely.\n\n“I smoked, but I didn’t get cancer.”\n“I bought a lottery ticket, but I didn’t win.”\n\nWe can use probability to quantify causal effects using counterfactuals. The effect of some antecedent event on an outcome is the probability of the outcome given the event occured minus the probability given the counterfactual.\nTo write this explicitly:\n\\(\\text{Causal Effect of A} = P(Outcome | A) - P(Outcome | \\neg A)\\)\n\n\nClick to show an explanation of this notation.\n\n\nGenerally, we can denote the probability of some event \\(X\\) as \\(P(X)\\).\nWhen one event depends on, or is conditional on another, we denote that \\(P(A|B)\\) or the “probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\)”.\nTo consider the counterfactual, we write \\(\\neg A\\) or “not A”, the event that \\(A\\) didn’t happen.\n\nWe’ll learn more about probability later in the course.",

    "section": "Creating Knowledge of Causal Effects",
    "text": "Creating Knowledge of Causal Effects\nGiven that the counterfactual is not what happened this time, we tend to make causal statements taking into account knowledge and past experience. To produce new knowledge so that we can quantify causal effects, we have two options: observation and experimentation.\n\nObservational Research\nThe first option is to estimate the difference between a fact and a counterfactual, finding the probabilities by very carefully analyzing historical data or real-world events. We can compare two existing groups, and make an assumption that they are similar enough to be compared (perhaps adjusting for a few variables).\n\n\nThe exact assumptions we make are very important and can mean the difference between strong and weak research.\nAs an example, we could find and observe two large groups of people: one group of folks who have smoked for the last ten years and another who have never smoked. We could test or survey these groups to compare the effect of smoking on their health.\nIt might still be hard to say whether smoking was the only variable that was different. Perhaps the two groups are different ages, have different diets, were located in different states, etc. It can be difficult to account for all the potential confounds that could undermine our assumptions.\n\n\nExperimental Research\nThe second option, to design an experiment, allows us to minimize our assumptions and create groups which differ in only variables we manipulate.\n\n\nExperiments rely the control that comes from setting variables to be constant or from introducing known randomness or statistically accounting for random factors.\nFor example, we select students and randomly assign them to two groups which either spend thirty minutes reading a physical book or thirty minutes listening to an audiobook. We then administer a memory test and compare the performance of the groups.\nExperiments are not quite immune from confounding variables, but well-designed experiments can certainly offer strong evidence of causal relationships since many potential confounders have been controlled.\nWhile controlled experiments offer stronger causal explanations, there are many situations where running an experiment is impossible There are situations where it may not be ethical to manipulate certain variables. For this reason we cannot design experiments to study topics like abuse or trauma. Some other topics may be impossible to study experimentally due to infeasability or high cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAn Important Note on Research Ethics\n\n\n\nHistory has shown us many examples of plainly unethical research experiments. Infamous studies you may have heard of include the Stanford Prison Experiment and the egregiously abusive Tuskegee Syphillis Study. We’ll cover a history of major ethical breaches at points throughout the semester.\nIn modern science, we carefully consider the ethics of any new research, experimental or observational. Medical research in particular is subject to strict legal and institutional regulation.",

    "section": "From Values to Vectors",
    "text": "From Values to Vectors\nBefore we can begin, we need to develop a sense for how R handles datasets.\nIn our first lab, we demonstrated how to store single values in variables, effectively giving them a name we can reference later.\n\nn &lt;- 42\nlucky_number &lt;- 7\nIDriveA &lt;- \"honda civic\"\n\n# Find the radius of a circle.\nx &lt;- 3.14159\nr &lt;- 7\n2*x*r\n\n[1] 43.98226\n\n\n\n\nHere we assign values to a few variables with arbitrary names: n, lucky_number, IDriveA, x, r.  We can use variables in mathematical expressions as demonstrated here by calculating the circumference of a circle with radius 7cm.\nOf course, when we collect data it’s actually many values we need to work with. In R, we can create vectors to hold long columns of values, as we might obtain from real data.\n\nsome_numbers &lt;- c(3, 6, 8, 12)\n\nsome_numbers\n\n[1]  3  6  8 12\n\n\n\n\nThe c() function combines several values into a vector.  As a shorthand, you can create sequences of numbers using the :, like: 1:10. Try this out in the console.\nAny mathematical calculations will work on the whole vector all at once. For example, we could do the circumference calculation again, this time for circles of a few different diameters.\n\nr &lt;- c(7, 36, 28, 1, 0)\n2*x*r\n\n[1]  43.98226 226.19448 175.92904   6.28318   0.00000\n\n\n\n\nCheck the last two elements and see that it has correctly listed \\(2 \\pi \\cdot 1 = 2\\pi\\) and \\(2\\pi \\cdot 0 = 0\\), for example.  This property of being able to perform calculations over whole vectors is what makes this computer software useful for statistics. Routine calculations on a whole dataset can be done quickly and precisely without a pen or calculator.\n\nQualitative Data Types\nWe can create vectors of qualitative variables too. R has one data type for both nominal and ordinal variables: the factor.\n\nhandedness &lt;- factor(c(\"Right-Handed\", \"Left-Handed\", \"Ambidextrous\"))\n\nhandedness\n\n[1] Right-Handed Left-Handed  Ambidextrous\nLevels: Ambidextrous Left-Handed Right-Handed\n\n\nR refers to the unique names a factor can take on as its levels.\n\n\nRandom Data\nIt’s often useful to be able to generate random data, whether to randomly assign participants to groups or to simulate what our results might look like. There are several functions to do with randomness, but we’ll start by demonstrating how to use the sample() function.\nA simple example is the roll of a die. This code will randomly take from the six possible face values, sampling the equivalent of 25 die rolls.\n\nsample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 25, replace=TRUE)\n\n [1] 6 5 3 2 6 4 2 6 1 5 3 3 3 4 6 3 4 4 4 6 5 5 3 6 1\n\n\n\n\nThe replace=TRUE means “sample with replacement”. In other words: take a random number from 1 to 6 and then put it back before taking a random number a second time, a third time, etc.\nCombining this with what we learned above about factor variables (nominal or ordinal data types), we can demonstrate one way to randomly assign ten participants to two groups.\n\n# Define a nominal variable (factor) with two levels: treatment and placebo.\nconditions &lt;- factor(c(\"treatment\", \"placebo\"))\n\n# Start with alternating (repeat), five in each group.\nassignment &lt;- c(rep(conditions, 5))\n\n# Randomize the variable so that 5 participants are assigned randomly to each (10 in total).\nassignment &lt;- sample(assignment, 10)\n\nassignment\n\n [1] treatment placebo   treatment placebo   placebo   treatment placebo  \n [8] treatment placebo   treatment\nLevels: placebo treatment\n\n\n\n\nAs you run each line, take a look at the conditions and assignment variables in your R environment.",

    "text": "Getting Ready to Code\nBy the end of the first assignment, we will be able to run a simple R program. Before we are able to do that, we will need to install a few things.\nEverything we need is described on posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you have doubts or start to feel like you’re not “tech savvy” enough as you complete these steps, please trust that these skills are learnable! You are highly encouraged to attend office hours for additional help.\n\n\n\nInstalling R\n\n\nR is a programming language and this first step will install an interpreter, the R Console, which will allow us to write to the computer specific instructions for describing, statistically analyzing, and producing graphics from our experimental data.\nThe first step is to install the R programming language itself. After completing this step, we will be able to open the R interpreter (R Console).\nOn the Posit webpage, click the link for Step 1: Install R. Select the appropriate download for your computer’s operating system (e.g. MacOS).\n\n\n\nR can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website.\n\n\nIf your computer is an Apple Mac/MacBook, you will need to download the appropriate package for your processor.\n\n\nFor Boston University students, if you encounter difficulties or if your primary device is a tablet, alternative access to a full installation of R/RStudio is possible through the BU Common virtual desktop.\n\nIf you know your Mac has an M1 or M2 processor (roughly since 2022) will require the first -arm64.pkg.\nIf you know your Mac has an Intel processor, it will require the second -x86_64.pkg.\n\n\n\n\nMost new Macs run on “Apple Silicon” M-series processors. If you’re not sure, please ask your teaching fellow or assume your Mac has a recent processor.\n\n\nIf your computer is a Windows PC download the base installer, following the instructions for installing R for the first time.\n\n\n\nClick “install R for the first time” for instructions. Ask your teaching fellow for assistance if you encounter any difficulties.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the package/executable for your operating system, run the installer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt the end of this step you should be able to find the R Console in your MacOS Launchpad/Applications or Windows Start menu.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling RStudio\nThe next step is to install RStudio, which we will be using extensively in this course.\n\n\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R language.\nOn the Posit website, see Step 2: Install RStudio. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.\n\nOn an Apple Mac/MacBook, you should download and open the .DMG file. You will see the RStudio app and a shortcut to your Applications folder. Drag the RStudio app into your Applications folder.\nOn a Windows PC, you should download and run the Windows .EXE executable installer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt the end of this step you should be able to find RStudio in your MacOS Launchpad/Applications or Windows Start menu.\n\n\n\n\nOrienting to RStudio\nWhile R is the programming language we will be using, the RStudio application provides us with a comprehensive graphical interface that includes tools to edit R code, view plots and help pages, debug scripts, and more.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, RStudio provides an interactive R Console, built in text-editor (for writing scripts), and functionality for viewing and exporting plots. Image credited to the authors of R4DS, reproduced here under license CC BY-NC-ND 3.0.\n\n\nThe Console pane is where we can type code directly into the R interpreter. Type a line of R language code and press Return to run it. The console is interactive and will show you the result immediately.\nThe Editor pane is where we can write R scripts. We can edit and rearrange text, copy-paste, and save our scripts for later. Try creating a new script and save it to a folder on your computer. With the cursor on a line of your script, press Control and Return; the line of code will automatically be copied and run in the Console pane. Note that the Run button runs the entire script, not just the current line.\n\n\nAn R script or program is a list of instructions to be run in order. We’ll usually conduct an entire analysis in a script.\nThe Output pane is where we can see plots and graphics we have generated. In this area you’ll also find a Files tab for navigating to folders of scripts and results, and a Help tab for viewing documentation for R commands/functions and datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOrienting yourself to new software is often a process of active exploration, and there’s always a lot more to learn. Spend some time exploring the menus of RStudio so that you are well-acquainted.\nThe goal is to eventually be able to make an educated guess at where you might go to find a particular menu or feature in the future.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Packages\nIn this course we’ll be using not only RStudio, but also several R packages.\nBefore we do anything else, we’ll install the R package tidyverse. Type the following in the Console and press Return.\n\n\ntidyverse is actually a metapackage (a collection of packages) including dplyr, tidyr, stringr, ggplot2 and more.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nA lot of output will appear in the console as the package is installing. When it finishes, the package has been installed. We won’t need to run this again; so there’s no need to keep this line of code in your script.",

    "text": "Demonstrating Graphics in R\nAs a motivating example, let’s consider the following short but complete script which will plot some experimental data. We’ll work through this code line-by-line in class to understand what it does.\nThe script will make a plot from an example dataset built-in to R called ChickWeight. The data comes from an experiment with four conditions: diets assigned to hatchling chicks. Their weight in grams is recorded every two days in the built in dataframe (table).\n\n\nMost built-in R functions and example datasets come with a help page that can be accessed by prepending a question mark to the object’s name.\nTo learn about this particular dataset, enter ?ChickWeight at the console.\nType the following R code snippet into a new script in your RStudio Editor pane. Click Save and save the script on your computer (e.g. Documents/PS211/lab1.R). Then click Run.\nYou should see that the code is automatically copied into the Console and run. A plot should appear in the Output pane, looking like the one below.\n\n1library(tidyverse)\n\n2ggplot(ChickWeight) +\n3  geom_point(\n4    aes(x=Time, y=weight, color=Diet),\n5    position=position_jitter()\n  ) +\n6  facet_grid(~Diet, labeller=label_both) +\n7  labs(\n    title=\"Experiment Comparing Weight Gain with Four Diets\",\n    x=\"Time (days)\",\n    y=\"Weight (g)\"\n  ) +\n8  theme_classic()\n\n\n1\n\nLoad in the tidyverse package (also called a library).\n\n2\n\nCreate a plot of the ChickWeight dataset (using ggplot).\n\n\n3\n\nAdd datapoints to the plot…\n\n\n4\n\n..where each datapoint’s (x,y) position is its Time and weight, colored by Diet.\n\n\n5\n\nRandomly “jitter” the points a little so they don’t overlap.\n\n\n6\n\nSplit up the plot by Diet.

This is good practice for getting used to the syntax and grammar of a new coding language. Click the number at the right of each line for an explanation.\nIf the console throws an error, it’s likely a simple fix, even if it’s hard to spot. Be careful to check the exact capitalization and spelling of your R code. In particular, make sure every opening parenthesis and quote has a close.\nHaving completed these steps successfully, you have written your first R program! Congratulations!\nIn upcoming lessons, we will learn more about the R language and how to use it for experiment design and simulation, statistical analysis, and reporting results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you encounter any technical issues it’s important to resolve them this first week with your teaching fellow so that you may participate fully in the rest of the course.",

    "text": "Randomness as Control\nWe can imbue our data with nice statistical properties by using randomness. This gives us a form of control we can use to bolster the strength of our assumptions even when there are some variables we can’t hold constant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe internet security company Cloudflare uses a camera to watch a wall of lava lamps. The unpredictability provides a high quality source of random data for security purposes.Image credited to HaeB on Wikimedia Commons, reproduced here under license CC-BY-SA 4.0.\n\n\n\nWhat is “Random”?\nEvents are random when they occur with some probability but are individually unpredictable. In other words, random outcomes are determined by chance.\nConsider two number sequences: 1231234545, 1656321345. Both orderings could be random, if generated spontaneously by an unpredictable process such as a repeated die roll.\nNote that randomness is different from uniformity. For outcomes to be uniform implies specifically that all the outcomes have an equal probability.\n\n\nWe can learn from these examples that randomness is about the process that generates the data, that the process is unpredictable.\n\n\nRandom Assignment\nIn experiments, we randomly assign participants to groups. This reduces the potential for systematic differences across groups and allows us to more safely attribute any observed difference in outcomes to the treatment.\n\n\nThe number of variables that could be affecting an observation really is endless. We can’t control for all of them separately. By performing random group assignment, we break any systematic relationships of group to any variable. We can then safely assume that the two groups are similar in all variables on average.\n\n\n\n\nOne issue we run into is that we want the group assignments to be random but want also for the groups to be the same size. There are several ways ways to accomplish both. For instance, we could pair up participants such that, in a random order, one is assigned to Group A and the other to Group B.",
